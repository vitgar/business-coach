## AI Assistant Integration

### AI Prompts and Instructions
- [ ] Update the Products and Services instructions in `ai-assist/route.ts` to include formatting for all fields
- [ ] Add prefix format instructions for each field type:
  - [ ] Product Overview: `overview`
  - [ ] Value Proposition: `valueProposition`
  - [ ] Intellectual Property: `intellectualProperty`
  - [ ] Future Products: `futureProducts`
  - [ ] Product Description: `productDescription`
- [ ] Add instructions about prefix removal in the suggestion application
- [ ] Include guidance on how to format suggestions for complex fields like product descriptions

### Field Pattern Matching
- [ ] Add pattern matching rules in `useBusinessPlanAI.ts` for all Products and Services fields:
  - [ ] Add pattern for overview field
  - [ ] Add pattern for value proposition field
  - [ ] Add pattern for intellectual property field
  - [ ] Add pattern for future products field
  - [ ] Add pattern for product descriptions
- [ ] Update the `fieldPatterns` object with the new patterns
- [ ] Ensure regexes properly capture content after the field prefix

### Suggestion Application Logic
- [ ] Update the `applySuggestion` function to handle Products and Services fields
- [ ] Add code to strip prefixes from all Products and Services field suggestions
- [ ] Implement special handling for complex fields (like product descriptions)
- [ ] Add logic to determine where to apply product description suggestions
- [ ] Update the `prefixFieldMap` in the backtick extraction logic to include Products and Services prefixes

### Field Inference Logic
- [ ] Implement inference logic to identify field types from content
- [ ] Add keywords and patterns to identify product-related content
- [ ] Add inference rules for each field in the Products and Services section
- [ ] Create debug logging for suggestion field matching

## Testing Tasks

### UI Testing
- [ ] Test form rendering for all fields
- [ ] Test product addition/removal functionality
- [ ] Test data saving and retrieval
- [ ] Test form validation
- [ ] Test responsive design on various screen sizes

### AI Integration Testing
- [ ] Test AI suggestions for each field type
- [ ] Verify correct extraction of field suggestions from AI responses
- [ ] Test prefix removal works correctly when applying suggestions
- [ ] Test field inference logic with various product-related content
- [ ] Verify suggestions are applied to the correct fields

### Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Test behavior with empty or invalid data
- [ ] Test error states during API calls
- [ ] Test recovery from errors
- [ ] Verify proper user feedback is shown

### Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Test with very long text inputs
- [ ] Test with special characters in text
- [ ] Test with many product descriptions (performance)
- [ ] Test applying suggestions to fields with existing content

## Finalization Tasks

### Documentation
- [ ] Document the Products and Services data structure
