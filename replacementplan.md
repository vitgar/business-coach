# Business Plan System Redesign

## Current Issues
1. Hardcoded business plan IDs causing 404 errors
2. Development configuration with hardcoded values
3. Complex code with multiple dependencies
4. Unclear data flow between components
5. Different components have inconsistent approaches to data handling

## Goals for New Implementation
1. Clean, consistent architecture
2. No hardcoded values, everything fetched from database
3. Clear separation of concerns between UI and data
4. Improved user experience
5. Simpler data model focused on essential features

## Component Structure
1. **BusinessPlanPage** - Main container that loads plan data
2. **BusinessPlanHeader** - Title, status, and actions
3. **BusinessPlanSections** - Navigation between plan sections
4. **BusinessPlanEditor** - Content editing interface
5. **BusinessPlanControls** - Save, export, share controls

## Data Flow
1. Page loads -> fetch plan by ID from database
2. Updates saved directly to database via API
3. Real-time validation and feedback
4. Clear loading and error states

## User Experience Improvements
1. Clear guidance when no business plans exist
2. Simple creation flow with minimal friction
3. Consistent UI elements and feedback
4. Progressive disclosure of advanced features

## Implementation Steps
1. Create basic data model and API endpoints
2. Implement core UI components
3. Add editing and saving functionality
4. Implement navigation between sections
5. Add export and sharing features

## Code Structure Recommendations
1. Use React Server Components where possible
2. Client components only for interactive elements
3. Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
4. Consistent error handling approach
5. Clear typing with TypeScript

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for data flow
3. End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
4. Accessibility testing

## Migration Strategy
1. Implement new system in parallel
2. Migrate existing data to new format
3. Switch users to new system once stable
4. Provide rollback option if issues occur

## Performance Considerations
1. Optimize data fetching with selective loading
2. Minimize client-side JavaScript
3. Efficient rendering with proper component structure
4. Appropriate caching strategy

## Implementation Status
### Completed
1. ✅ Fixed hardcoded business IDs in DEV_CONFIG
2. ✅ Created new component structure in src/components/business-plan-new/
3. ✅ Implemented BusinessPlanPage main container
